### 1ProjectAWeek - Week 3 

This project was built as part the One Project A Week Challenge (1ProjectAWeek).


This project was built on week 3 using Java along with the Springboot framework. . [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is also used but mostly just for the frontend

The project is a simple chat web application made using a WebSocket which is a thin, lightweight layer above TCP. It suitable for using “subprotocols” to embed messages.

The application sends messages back and forth between a browser and a server. The frontend could be hosted seperately but for simplicity they are both here.

Note: Had a problem using Gradle to build this project, the projects works with Maven though.

##### Learning Springboot

The guide I used can be found [here](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket).

I also watched some tutorials: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TywlS9iAZCM), and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO5FoCRgMyw&t=69s)

Ran into some problems but were resolved by using Maven instead of Gradle.
